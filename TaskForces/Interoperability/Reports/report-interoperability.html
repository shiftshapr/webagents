    <section id="abstract">
      <p>Advances in language agents that can follow instructions and use tools have renewed interest in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. Like previous generations of agents, language agents are designed for specific tasks, highlighting the need for open networks of agents that complement each other's abilities to tackle more complex problems. New protocols are rapidly emerging to allow agents to discover and use tools, or to discover and interact with other agents. Some of these protocols build on Web standards to promote interoperability, but their alignments, misalignments, and overlaps are unclear. This report synthesizes the large body of research on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) to define a conceptual model for understanding Web-based MAS. We use this conceptual model to classify existing technologies and frameworks, to identify relevant standards within the W3C, and to discover standardization gaps (if any).</p>

        <h3>Visions of Agents on the Web</h3>

        <aside class="issue">
          <p>The vision of agents on the Web is almost as old as the Web itself. This section is to give a concise overview for contextualization. Relevant: WWW94 keynote, DARPA research programs (CoABS and DAML) and the Semantic Web, AgentCities and FIPA, and the recent Dagstuhl seminars.</p>

        <aside class="issue">
          <p>This section is to summarize the large body of related work. We provide a concise overview and defer the details to annexes and existing literature.</p>

          <aside class="issue">
            <p>This section is to summarize the research on Web-based MAS, from service-oriented computing in the early 2000s to current work on Hypermedia MAS.</p>

        <h3>Architectural Considerations</h3>
      
        <aside class="issue">
          <p>Different approaches choose different distribution styles, e.g. MCP uses an RPC-style of distribution. This section discusses these different styles with reference to the Web architecture. The discussion could go into many directions, what emerged in our meetings is a need to look deeper than the agent level of abstraction. What seems important is to identify alignments and misalignments with the Web architecture.</p>

        <h3>Conceptual Overview and Modeling Dimensions</h3>
      
        <aside class="issue">
          <p>We need a conceptual model for Web-based MAS to organize the discussion and emerging technologies. We can follow the four modelling dimensions used in research on engineering MAS: agent, environment, interaction, and organization.</p>
